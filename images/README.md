This folder contains various visualizations that represent different aspects of the dataset and model performance. Below is a detailed description of each visualization.

## Visualizations
- **Correlation Matrix:**
This matrix shows the correlation between different features in the dataset, providing insight into how variables are related to each other.


- **Distribution of Response:**
This chart displays the distribution of the target variable Response. It shows the frequency of positive and negative responses in the dataset.

- **Distribution Based on Gender:**
Description: This chart shows the distribution of the Gender variable, illustrating the proportion of male and female customers.

- **Gender Distribution:**
Description: This visualization represents the count of responses from different genders, helping to understand the gender demographics of the dataset.

- **Distribution of Age:**
Description: This chart displays the distribution of the Age variable, showing the age range and frequency of customers in the dataset.

- **Histograms of Selected Columns:**
Description: These histograms show the distribution of values for selected columns such as Annual_Premium, Policy_Sales_Channel, and Vintage. They provide insight into the data distribution for these features.

- **F1 Score Comparison:**
