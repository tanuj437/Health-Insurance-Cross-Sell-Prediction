```

- XGBoost
```
Description: An implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.
Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 88%.
```

- Naive Bayes
```
Description: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions.
Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 64%.
```
- LightGBM
```
Description: A Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) was trained for high performance and efficiency with large datasets.
Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 88%.
```
- Neural Network
```
Description: A basic feedforward neural network used for classification tasks.
Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 88%.
```
- Ridge Classifier
```
Description: A linear classifier with L2 regularization to avoid overfitting.
Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 88%.
```
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier
```
Description: A linear classifier optimized using stochastic gradient descent.
